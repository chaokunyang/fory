# C++

Load this file when changing `cpp/`, Cython build plumbing, or C++ xlang behavior.

## Rules

- All commands must be executed within the `cpp/` directory.
- Use C++17 in `cpp/`; do not introduce newer language features.
- Bazel uses bzlmod via `MODULE.bazel`; prefer Bazel 8+.
- C++ code must compile without compiler warnings. Treat warnings as blockers in Bazel, generated code, and native build plumbing.
- For Bazel C++ tests, add `--config=x86_64` only on `x86_64` or `amd64`. Do not use it on `arm64` or `aarch64`.
- Run `clang-format` on updated C++ files.
- When invoking a method that returns `Result`, use `FORY_TRY` unless you are in control-flow logic that cannot use it cleanly.
- Wrap error checks with `FORY_PREDICT_FALSE` for branch prediction.
- Continue on trivial errors; return early only for critical errors such as buffer overflow.
- `ReadContext` intentionally records codec errors for inspection at existing serializer or root
  safepoints. After an error, work may continue only while it remains bounds-safe and cannot cause
  resource amplification, publish reference or cache state that survives root cleanup, or return
  success past the required safepoint. Do not add per-field checks, cursor rollback, or tests that
  pin the first detection point solely to make an error earlier or more precise.
- Put private methods last in class definitions, immediately before private fields.
- Do not redesign alias-based or low-level public type shapes to add convenience methods unless the user explicitly asks for that API change.
- For cross-language feature ports, match protocol behavior but use idiomatic C++ ownership and layering instead of mirroring Java structure literally.
- Compatible scalar, list-array, and binary/uint8-array adaptations are immediate-field-only. Recursive matched-field comparison for collection elements, array elements, map keys, and map values must require exact nullability, ref tracking, generic arity, and type shape except documented user-type family normalization.
- Root deserialization graph budget state belongs to `ReadContext` and is initialized by the root
  `Fory::deserialize` overload. Keep `max_graph_memory_bytes` as a fixed-default graph limit:
  unset/default is `128 MiB`, positive explicit values override it, and explicit non-positive
  values are invalid at config creation. Byte and stream roots use the same
  configured/default budget behavior. Root `Fory` overloads reset the budget only; they must not
  pre-reserve root type or root self bytes.
  Do not mirror the configured max into a second active-limit field; use config plus mutable
  remaining budget.
  Reserve estimated shallow graph-owner memory before allocation while preserving existing
  byte-availability checks and their non-empty metadata ordering. `ReadContext` may expose only raw
  byte reservation; collection, map, array, struct, and object formulas belong in serializer owners.
  Skip dedicated string, binary, primitive scalar, primitive
  vector, and primitive dense-array leaf owners; `std::vector<bool>` charges rounded packed-bit
  storage. Treat the option as an approximate collection/map/array/struct/object gate, not an exact
  heap cap. Leaf values skipped by graph budgeting remain gated by unread input bytes.
  General `std::vector<T>` for non-primitive `T` is inline value storage and must be reserved by the
  vector owner.
- C++ graph budget formulas must be portable lower-bound estimates, not STL heap-layout accounting.
  Generic collection-like containers reserve `count_or_capacity * sizeof(value_type)`, map-like
  containers reserve `count * (sizeof(key_type) + sizeof(mapped_type))`, and set-like containers
  reserve `count * sizeof(key_type)`. Smart-pointer, box, and dynamic allocation owners reserve
  `sizeof(T)` when they materialize pointed heap storage; root/plain struct/product serializers do
  not reserve their own self storage. Do not add guessed
  node/header/debug-STL overhead, red-black-tree fields, allocator probing, object-layout
  inspection, generic per-entry pointer overhead, or unordered bucket-table guesses.

## Key Paths

- `cpp/fory/row`
- `cpp/fory/meta`
- `cpp/fory/encoder`
- `cpp/fory/util`

## Commands

```bash
# Build the C++ library
bazel build //cpp/...

# Build the Cython extension (replace X.Y with the Python version)
bazel build //:cp_fory_so --@rules_python//python/config_settings:python_version=X.Y

# Run all C++ tests
bazel test $(bazel query //cpp/...)

# Run serialization tests
bazel test $(bazel query //cpp/fory/serialization/...)

# Run a specific test
bazel test //cpp/fory/util:buffer_test

# Format a file
clang-format -i <file>
```

## Java-Driven Xlang Test

```bash
cd java
mvn -T16 install -DskipTests
cd fory-core
FORY_CPP_JAVA_CI=1 ENABLE_FORY_DEBUG_OUTPUT=1 mvn -T16 test -Dtest=org.apache.fory.xlang.CPPXlangTest
```

## Debugging And Profiling

- See `docs/development/cpp-debugging.md` for C++ debugging guidance.
- Generate `compile_commands.json` with `bazel run :refresh_compile_commands`.
- DTrace-based stack sampling is documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
