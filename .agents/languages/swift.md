# Swift

Load this file when changing `swift/` or Swift xlang behavior.

## Rules

- Run Swift commands from within `swift/`.
- Changes under `swift/` must pass lint and tests.
- Swift code must compile without compiler warnings. Treat warnings as blockers, including warnings in generated Swift code.
- Swift lint uses `swift/.swiftlint.yml`.
- Use `ENABLE_FORY_DEBUG_OUTPUT=1` when debugging Swift tests.
- Prefer the user-requested or existing Foundation public value type when it is the intended Swift surface; do not invent Fory-prefixed wrappers only to avoid import ambiguity.
- Preserve distinct temporal semantics. Timestamp values and day-only local dates should have protocol-accurate helper names and no stale aliases after a refactor.
- When temporal or public-type refactors touch generated Swift code, sweep message fields, union payloads, macros, xlang harnesses, and integration fixtures together.
- Compatible scalar, list-array, and binary/uint8-array adaptations are immediate-field-only. Recursive matched-field comparison for collection elements, array elements, map keys, and map values must require exact nullability, ref tracking, generic arity, and type shape except documented user-type family normalization.
- Root deserialization graph memory budget state belongs to `ReadContext`. Swift public roots are
  `Data` and `ByteBuffer`, so auto uses known root bytes; do not add stream bytes-read accounting or
  serializer-local budget state. `ReadContext` may expose only raw byte reservation and generic
  counted-byte arithmetic; array, set, map, struct, and object formulas belong in serializer and
  field-codec owners.
- For Swift graph budget formulas, distinguish inline/value storage from reference storage: use
  `MemoryLayout<T>.stride` for value arrays/lists/sets/maps and the 4-byte reference fallback for
  `Serializer.isRefType` / `FieldCodec.isRefType` paths. Class/reference paths reserve their own
  shallow self cost plus field storage when materialized; value serializers do not unconditionally
  charge self storage because root, field, array, set, map, box, or generated owners reserve inline
  storage exactly once. Independently materialized collection/map/array owners reserve nonzero
  shallow self cost plus backing/reference/inline storage. Dedicated `String`, `Data`/binary,
  primitive scalar, and primitive packed-array owners stay skipped, except compatible
  packed-array-to-list reads must reserve the target list materialization before allocation.

## Commands
