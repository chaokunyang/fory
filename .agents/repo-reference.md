## Protocol Overview

Apache Fory is a multi-language serialization framework with multiple wire formats. Read the relevant spec before touching any protocol behavior.

- Xlang serialization format: `docs/specification/xlang_serialization_spec.md`
- Row format: `docs/specification/row_format_spec.md`
- Java serialization format: `docs/specification/java_serialization_spec.md`
- Type mapping: `docs/specification/xlang_type_mapping.md`

## Compiler And IDL Notes

- Primary references:
  - `docs/compiler/index.md`
  - `docs/compiler/compiler-guide.md`
  - `docs/compiler/schema-idl.md`
  - `docs/compiler/type-system.md`
  - `docs/compiler/generated-code.md`
  - `docs/compiler/protobuf-idl.md`
  - `docs/compiler/flatbuffers-idl.md`
- Compiler location: `compiler/`
- Install and CLI:
  - `cd compiler && pip install -e .`
  - `foryc --help`
  - `foryc schema.fdl --lang <langs> --output <dir>`
- Never edit generated code manually. Update the source schema or IDL and regenerate.
- Protocol changes must update `docs/specification/**` and the relevant cross-language tests.
- Remote `TypeDef` or `TypeMeta` schema limits are resource controls on cold metadata cache-miss
  parse/publish paths only. They must not change wire format, registration, dynamic type loading,
  unknown-type behavior, deserialization policy, schema-evolution semantics, or metadata
  cache-hit/generated-reader hot paths. Count a remote metadata version only after the required read
  state has been successfully built and the owning metadata cache can publish it; failed or
  incompatible metadata must not consume the limit. Struct types may have multiple schema-evolution
  versions; compatible named enum/ext/union metadata normally has one version but still counts
  against remote metadata total limits when it is sent as shared metadata. Pure id-based enum, ext,
  and typed-union values use type id plus user type id and must not be moved onto this metadata
  cache path. Exact-local metadata bypass is not struct-only: after the existing type and
  deserialization-policy checks for the selected local type, compare the original received encoded
  bytes with the local encoded metadata bytes, and allow exact matches for struct and named
  enum/ext/union metadata without consuming remote schema-version limits. Derive the local
  exact-match candidate inside the metadata owner from the decoded `userTypeId` or
  `(namespace, typeName)` identity; do not add caller-threaded expected-type parameters only for
  this check in any runtime. Java and Python may lazy-build local metadata bytes only after this
  identity lookup selects a local class and the existing class, registration, and deserialization
  policy checks have run. A runtime may also skip a received metadata body when the current
  declared type already owns an identical local metadata header; that is a local-schema hit, not a
  remote cache publish, and it must not consume schema-version limits. Other header-only skips are
  allowed only after the same owning remote metadata cache has validated a previous body for that
  header.
- Remote metadata body and struct field-count limits are also cold-path resource controls.
  `maxTypeMetaBytes` limits one received TypeDef or TypeMeta body excluding the 8-byte header and
  extended-size varint; `maxTypeFields` limits one received struct metadata body's field count
  (Java native TypeDef counts total fields across class layers). Check these before body
  copy/decompression and before field-list allocation, and never add cache-hit or generated-reader
  hot-path work for them.

## Shared Debugging Heuristics

- For protocol issues, start with the relevant spec before changing code.
- For performance issues, profile first and verify memory-allocation behavior and ownership boundaries.
- For build issues, prefer clean rebuilds and explicit dependency-version checks before assuming tool bugs.
- For Bazel-specific build issues, use `bazel clean --expunge` when a deep clean is needed.
