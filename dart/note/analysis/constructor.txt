This is not considered a Redirecting Constructor

ConstructorElement::superConstructor parameter is the parent class constructor used by the current constructor.
Since a class can have more than one constructor, this represents which parent class constructor is chosen by the current constructor being analyzed.
Note that using super.param in the parameters also counts as using the parent class constructor (obviously, this is the unnamed constructor of the parent class).

ConstructorElement::redirectedConstructor parameter is the redirecting constructor used by the current constructor.
Note that the parent class constructor is not a redirecting constructor, even if it is called using :super(...).

Even if a class does not declare a constructor, there will be a default constructor, in which case isDefaultConstructor will be true.
