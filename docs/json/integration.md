## Spring Fory

[spring-fory](https://github.com/chaokunyang/spring-fory) provides Spring MVC message converters,
Spring WebFlux codecs, and Spring Boot auto-configuration starters for Fory JSON. It supports
ordinary JSON request and response bodies, with streaming JSON and NDJSON support in WebFlux.

See the project's [installation and usage guide](https://github.com/chaokunyang/spring-fory#installation)
to select the adapter or starter matching your Spring version and configure your application.

## Kotlin integration

Use `jsonTypeRef<Any?>(kType)` when a framework supplies a Kotlin `KType` at runtime and the
callback cannot use a reified type argument. The supplied `KType` determines the complete JSON
type, including nested generic arguments and nullability. `Any?` is only the callback's static
view of the value; it does not replace the supplied type with a dynamic JSON schema.

Obtaining a `KType` from a Kotlin function or a Java `Method` requires the application's
`kotlin-reflect` dependency. Match its version to the application's Kotlin version:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation(kotlin("reflect"))
}
```

For example, discover and retain a controller method's response type:

```kotlin
import java.io.OutputStream
import kotlin.reflect.jvm.kotlinFunction
import org.apache.fory.json.kotlin.ForyJsonKotlin
import org.apache.fory.json.kotlin.jsonTypeRef

data class Employee(val id: Long, val name: String)
data class Response<T>(val flag: Boolean, val data: T? = null, val msg: String? = null)

class EmployeeController {
  fun employees(): Response<List<Employee>> =
    Response(true, listOf(Employee(1, "Alice")))
}

val json = ForyJsonKotlin.builder().build()
val method = EmployeeController::class.java.getMethod("employees")
val responseType = jsonTypeRef<Any?>(requireNotNull(method.kotlinFunction).returnType)

fun writeResponse(value: Any?, output: OutputStream) {
  json.writeJsonTo(value, responseType, output)
}

fun readResponse(bytes: ByteArray): Any? = json.fromJson(bytes, responseType)
```

Discover each declared type once and reuse its token. For request bodies, obtain the corresponding
Kotlin value parameter's `KType`. A method with unresolved type parameters still needs its concrete
type arguments before conversion; star projections and contravariant projections remain unsupported.
If you select a static type more specific than `Any?`, the caller must ensure it matches the
supplied `KType`.

For Spring MVC, retain the controller's Kotlin declaration when adapting the request or response
to a converter. A `SmartHttpMessageConverter` can receive application-provided read/write hints
containing that `KType` or its Fory type token. When an HTTP wrapper such as
`ResponseEntity<Response<List<Employee>>>` is present, select the body type
`Response<List<Employee>>` before constructing the token.

An `AbstractHttpMessageConverter` callback that supplies only the runtime object loses generic
arguments. `AbstractGenericHttpMessageConverter` preserves Java generics, but
`TypeRef.of(javaType)` does not restore Kotlin nullability. Neither a Java `Type` nor the runtime
value alone can recover the full Kotlin declaration. Use `jsonTypeRef(kType)` after obtaining that
declaration; this API does not automatically install a Spring converter.
