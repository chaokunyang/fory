Apache Fory™ Go implements the Standard Row Format used by Java, C++, Python, and Rust in the
`github.com/apache/fory/go/fory/row` package. It provides a reflection-based struct encoder,
zero-copy readers for random field access, and the cross-language schema encoding.

## Overview

Use Row Format when readers need selected fields or collection elements rather than a fully
reconstructed value. Readers are views over the encoded bytes: reading one field costs a bitmap
test and a slot lookup, and other fields are never touched.

Row Format is a trusted in-memory format. Decode only bytes produced by a Fory row writer for the
same schema, from a source you trust. Malformed bytes surface as errors from the encoder's decode
methods, but the format does not defend against hostile input the way object serialization does.

## When to Use Row Format

- Analytics workloads with selective field access
- Large datasets where only a subset of fields is needed
- Memory-mapped or shared data read by several languages
- High-throughput pipelines that exchange Standard Row bytes with Java, C++, Python, or Rust

## Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/apache/fory/go/fory/row"
)

type UserProfile struct {
    Id          int64
    Username    string
    Email       *string
    Scores      []int32
    Preferences map[string]string
    IsActive    bool
}

func main() {
    encoder, err := row.NewEncoder[UserProfile]()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    email := "alice@example.com"
    profile := UserProfile{
        Id:          12345,
        Username:    "alice",
        Email:       &email,
        Scores:      []int32{95, 87, 92, 88},
        Preferences: map[string]string{"theme": "dark", "language": "en"},
        IsActive:    true,
    }

    rowBytes, err := encoder.ToRow(&profile)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Random access without decoding the whole struct.
    schema := encoder.Schema()
    r := row.NewRow(schema, rowBytes)
    fmt.Println(r.String(schema.FieldIndex("username"))) // alice
    fmt.Println(r.Array(schema.FieldIndex("scores")).Int32(1)) // 87
    fmt.Println(r.IsNullAt(schema.FieldIndex("email")))        // false

    // Full decode when the whole value is needed.
    decoded, err := encoder.FromRow(rowBytes)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(decoded.Preferences["theme"]) // dark
}
```

`NewEncoder[T]` infers the schema from the struct type once and compiles the conversion for it.
Creating an encoder is comparatively expensive; create one per struct type and reuse it.

## Rows and Framed Messages

`ToRow` and `FromRow` work with bare row bytes, which is what the other languages' `toRow` and
`BinaryRow.pointTo` exchange. `Encode` and `Decode` add the framing used by the Java and Python
row encoders: an 8-byte little-endian schema hash followed by the row.

```go
framed, err := encoder.Encode(&profile)   // hash + row
decoded, err := encoder.Decode(framed)    // verifies the hash, then decodes
```

The hash is a type-shape fingerprint: it folds the recursive field type ids and nothing else, so
`Decode` rejects a writer whose field types differ but cannot detect renamed fields, changed
nullability, or reordered fields of the same type. Share the schema bytes (see
[Schema Exchange](#schema-exchange)) when peers must agree on more than the type shape.

`Decode` and `FromRow` return errors for truncated or inconsistent bytes; they never panic. Decoded
values never alias the input, so the input buffer can be reused immediately.

## Zero-Copy Reading

`row.NewRow(schema, bytes)` creates a view over a row. `Struct`, `Array`, and `Map` return views
over the nested bytes, and `Binary` returns a sub-slice of the input. These views stay valid only
while the underlying bytes are alive and unmodified. `String` copies, because a Go string must not
observe later changes to the buffer.

```go
r := row.NewRow(schema, rowBytes)
tags := r.Array(schema.FieldIndex("tags"))
for i := 0; i < tags.NumElements(); i++ {
    if !tags.IsNullAt(i) {
        fmt.Println(tags.String(i))
    }
}
attrs := r.Map(schema.FieldIndex("attrs"))
fmt.Println(attrs.Keys().String(0), attrs.Values().Int32(0))
```

Fixed-width getters return the zero value for null fields; use `IsNullAt` to distinguish null from
zero. Variable-width getters return `nil` (or `""`) for null. Out-of-range indexes panic, as does
malformed data read through a raw view; use the encoder's decode methods when an error is needed.

## Nullability

A Go pointer field is a nullable field: `nil` writes the null bit and decodes back to `nil`.
Slices, maps, and `[]byte` are nullable as well and distinguish `nil` from empty.

Strings, nested value structs, `fory.Date`, `time.Time`, and `time.Duration` are also nullable in
the schema because their Java carriers are objects, but the Go value cannot hold `nil`. Decoding a
null into one of these fields is an error. Use a pointer carrier (`*string`, `*time.Time`, `*Inner`)
when nulls must round-trip, for example when reading rows written by Java with `null` values.

Map values are always nullable and map keys never are, matching the other languages. A `[]*int32`
element or `map[string]*int32` value carries a null element; `[]int32` and `map[string]int32` do
not.

## Field Order and Names

Fields are sorted by their lowerCamel name and named by its snake_case form (`UserName` becomes
`user_name`), matching Java's schema inference so both languages derive the same schema from
equivalent struct definitions. Unexported fields are skipped. The `fory` struct tag uses the same
grammar as object serialization: `fory:"-"`, `fory:"ignore"`, and `fory:"ignore=true"` skip a
field; other keys are accepted and ignored by Row Format.

Changing a field name or type changes the schema. Coordinate such changes across all producers and
consumers.

| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| `bool`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`     | Fixed-width scalar               | No       |
| `int`                                         | Fixed-width int64                | No       |

| `time.Time`                                   | Fixed-width epoch microseconds   | Yes      |
| `time.Duration`                               | Fixed-width microseconds         | Yes      |
| `string`                                      | Variable-width UTF-8             | Yes      |
| `[]byte`                                      | Standard array of int8           | Yes      |
| `[]T` for supported element types             | Standard array                   | Yes      |
| `map[K]V`                                     | Standard map                     | Yes      |
| Nested struct                                 | Nested Standard Row              | Yes      |
| `*T` for any supported non-slice, non-map `T` | Same encoding as `T`             | Yes      |

`[]byte` matches Java's `byte[]`, which Java also infers as a list of int8. The row format's
binary type is available only to hand-built schemas through `RowWriter.WriteBytes` and
`Row.Binary`.

Strings must be valid UTF-8. Timestamps must fit in an int64 number of microseconds. Map keys must
be scalars, strings, or value structs whose exported, non-ignored fields consist of such types, so
that the encoded key determines Go equality. `time.Time`, `time.Duration`, and pointers are not
valid keys, including inside struct keys. Duration encoding truncates to microseconds, so distinct
nanosecond keys could otherwise collapse into one entry. Use an explicit `int64` key in the unit
your application requires.

Unsupported: unsigned integers, fixed-size arrays, nested pointers, pointers to slices or maps,
interfaces, channels, functions, recursive types, `float16`, and `decimal`.

## Schema Exchange

`SchemaToBytes` and `SchemaFromBytes` implement the cross-language schema encoding shared with
Java's `SchemaEncoder` and Python's `Schema.to_bytes`/`from_bytes`. `ComputeSchemaHash` computes
the same type-shape hash used by `Encode`.

```go
schemaBytes, err := row.SchemaToBytes(encoder.Schema())
schema, err := row.SchemaFromBytes(schemaBytes)
fmt.Println(schema.Equal(encoder.Schema())) // true
```

A Java bean and a Go struct with equivalent fields produce identical schema bytes when their
nullability matches: use pointer fields for Java boxed types (`Integer`, `String` in lists) and
value fields for Java primitives.

## Writing Rows by Hand

`RowWriter`, `ArrayWriter`, and `MapWriter` write rows for a schema you construct yourself, without
a Go struct. They share one `fory.ByteBuffer`; a nested value is written at the buffer's current
position and then attached to its parent slot with `SetOffsetAndSize`.

```go
schema := row.NewSchema([]row.Field{
    row.NewField("id", row.Int64Type{}, false),
    row.NewField("tags", row.List(row.StringType{}), true),
})
w := row.NewRowWriter(schema)
w.Reset()
w.WriteInt64(0, 7)

tags := row.NewArrayWriter(row.List(row.StringType{}).Elem, w.Buffer())
start := w.Buffer().WriterIndex()
if err := tags.Reset(2); err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
if err := tags.WriteString(0, "go"); err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
tags.SetNullAt(1)
if err := w.SetOffsetAndSize(1, start, w.Buffer().WriterIndex()-start); err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
rowBytes := w.ToBytes() // valid until the buffer is written to again
```

Call `Reset` before each row; to reuse a writer for a new top-level row, set the buffer's writer
index back to zero first.

## Thread Safety

An `Encoder` owns a reusable write buffer and is not safe for concurrent use; create one encoder
per goroutine or guard it with a mutex. Writers share the same rule. `Row`, `ArrayData`, and
`MapData` views only read, so one view can be shared by concurrent readers as long as the
underlying bytes are not modified.
