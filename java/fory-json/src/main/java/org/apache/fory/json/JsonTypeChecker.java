/**
 * Checks whether Fory JSON may create or reuse metadata for a Java class name.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must be thread-safe. Fory JSON invokes the checker from shared resolver and
 * codec setup paths and does not synchronize around user checker state. The class name is passed as
 * a String so class-name materialization paths can apply policy without requiring a second API.
 *
 * <p>Classes served by default built-in exact JSON codecs do not invoke the configured checker
 * unless a custom codec is registered for the same class or selected by {@code @JsonCodec}. Arrays
 * are checked through their ultimate component type, and enum constant-specific subclasses are
 * normalized to their enclosing enum. Fory's disallow list always runs before this callback and
 * cannot be bypassed by a built-in or custom codec.
 *
 * <p>Decisions are shared by class name across the runtime's pooled states and cached up to a
 * bounded number of distinct names. Once the cache is full, new names invoke the checker each time
 * rather than growing untrusted state.
 *
 * <p>For an inferred sealed {@code JsonSubTypes} table, this checker may reject exact concrete
 * candidates to narrow the statically authorized closure; rejecting every candidate fails schema
 * construction. An explicit non-empty subtype table remains exact and fails if any entry is
 * rejected. Fory's fixed disallow list validates the complete inferred closure before narrowing.
