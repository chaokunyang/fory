/**
 * Configures the canonical JSON name, serialization index, and null-inclusion policy of one logical
 * property.
 *
 * <p>Fory JSON first groups an eligible field, getter, and setter by their Java property name. An
 * annotation on any one of those members configures the complete logical property. Repeating the
 * same explicit name, index, or inclusion policy is allowed; conflicting non-default declarations
 * are rejected when the object's metadata is built. {@link JsonIgnore} still removes the configured
 * read or write direction and cannot be overridden by this annotation.
 *
 * <p>This annotation is invalid on a logical property claimed by {@link JsonAnyProperty} or {@link
 * JsonAnyGetter}, and directly on a {@link JsonAnySetter}. Dynamic members have no fixed JSON name
 * or fixed-property inclusion policy.
 *
 * <p>On a {@link JsonCreator} parameter, this annotation supplies the input JSON name in
 * parameter-local creator mode. Creator parameter names are explicit and are never transformed by
 * the configured property naming strategy.
