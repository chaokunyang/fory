/**
 * Declares a complete, finite subtype table for an interface or abstract base type.
 *
 * <p>JSON contains only the logical {@link Type#name() subtype name}; it never contains or selects
 * a Java class name. Every entry is resolved from either a class literal or a static binary class
 * name supplied by trusted application code. The table is validated atomically before it can be
 * used, including assignability, concreteness, duplicate-name, security, and type-checker rules.
 * Runtime registration and open subtype discovery are intentionally unsupported.
 *
 * <p>When {@link #value()} is empty, Fory infers the concrete members of the base's sealed
 * hierarchy. The user-selected base authorizes that static closure; JSON input still selects only a
 * prevalidated logical name and never discovers a class. A non-empty value is an exact explicit
 * subset. Applications that do not trust the complete sealed closure should declare that subset or
 * configure {@code JsonTypeChecker}, which filters inferred exact candidates before publication.
 *
 * <p>{@link Inclusion#PROPERTY} is the default representation and writes an inline discriminator
 * property as the first object member. {@link Inclusion#WRAPPER_OBJECT} writes one outer member
 * whose name is the subtype name. {@link Inclusion#WRAPPER_ARRAY} writes the subtype name and value
 * as a two-element array. Both wrapper modes delegate the complete subtype representation.
 * Serialization accepts only an exact runtime class present in the table; subclasses of listed
 * entries are not accepted implicitly. Property inclusion requires the ordinary object
 * representation so its members can follow the discriminator, while wrapper inclusions permit an
 * exact custom codec for a subtype. A null base value is encoded as plain JSON {@code null}
 * regardless of the selected inclusion.
